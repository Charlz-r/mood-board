## **1. Algorithmic Thinking & Generative Art**  
🔹 **Core Idea:** Using code to generate and manipulate visuals dynamically.  
🔹 **Example:** Audio-reactive visuals, fractal-based compositions, and recursive patterns.  
🔹 **Relevance to Final Project:** Governing particle behavior through algorithmic rules to create fluid dynamics.  

## **2. Randomness & Simulation**  
🔹 **Core Idea:** Exploring the difference between true randomness and algorithmic randomness in visual art.  
🔹 **Supporting Material:**  
   - [Wave Function Collapse Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iSAvzU2WYY) – Procedural pattern generation.  
   - [Chrome Music Lab – Lines](https://lines.chromeexperiments.com/) – Randomness in interactive music visualization.  
🔹 **Relevance to Final Project:** Introducing controlled randomness for turbulence effects in the fluid simulation.  

## **3. Interactive Motion Art & TouchDesigner**  
🔹 **Core Idea:** Using motion tracking to manipulate digital visuals in real-time.  
🔹 **Example:** Particle systems responding to body movement, pose detection-based distortions.  
🔹 **Relevance to Final Project:** Implementing real-time interaction where gestures could affect flow direction and intensity.  

## **4. Pixel Manipulation & Noise Fields**  
🔹 **Core Idea:** Low-level control over image data for warping, distortion, and generative effects.  
🔹 **Example:** Perlin noise for organic textures, pixel sorting for glitch effects, displacement maps for warping.  
🔹 **Relevance to Final Project:** Using noise fields to create realistic turbulence and velocity-driven color shifts.  

## **5. Dome Projection & Map Distortions**  
🔹 **Core Idea:** Understanding how 3D spherical data translates into 2D representations.  
🔹 **Example:** Equirectangular vs. Mercator projections, distortion issues, fisheye warping.  
🔹 **Relevance to Final Project:** Ensuring accurate rendering if expanded into dome projection environments.
